Christian~7:57am~Aug 14, 2017~The xbox blow up at the cottage. I replaced it with a spare one at our house and will bring it up at the end of the month. If you want it before then you can pick it up at our house.
~Marlene~10:18am~Aug 07, 2017~Hello fellow cottagers! I have booked a lot of time mid August only because it was free. You are more than welcome to come anytime between the 22nd and the 24th. I'll be there with my kids and we'd love to have you :) 
~Jen~11:14am~Jul 05, 2017~Can I book the canoe for next weekend?? We're going canoe camping and I see no one has booked the cottage yet. That failing, I wonder if our gear will fit on the party island...?
~Dad~8:50am~May 06, 2017~Rosalie & Marc will be at the cottage May 11-31 but will vacate if you want to use the cottage in that period.
~Dad~3:57pm~Apr 19, 2017~I've supplied TP. A better place to post items needed is on the Items Needed page, because there they can be deleted when they've been taken care of.
~Marlene~8:09pm~Apr 02, 2017~Hi all! Just had a great time at the cottage :) A couple of things, please clean out the fireplace if you use it. I had to clean it out, it was full to the top and overflowing in the bottom part that you pull out. I've never seen it that  bad. Also, we need toilet paper. We're almost out! That's it! Have fun folks :)

~Maria~8:58pm~Feb 13, 2017~I\'m open to sharing time during \'my bookings\' this summer - please let me know and we\'ll work around it. Lots of space!
~Dad~9:46am~Aug 14, 2016~Coming soon: new blinds in the second upstairs bedroom.
~Christian~9:59am~Jul 05, 2016~The pipe that collects the water from the eves trough in the corner of the cottage is plugged. It needs to be left disconnected to allow the water to empty.
~Marlene~12:34pm~May 08, 2016~Hi everyone! I did #11, #13, #14 on the maintenance checklist. The cottage is absolutely gorgeous this time of year, it was so nice to be up there, even if I was doing work ;)
~Marlene~1:21pm~May 01, 2016~Hi everyone! I just want to let you know that I\'ve booked the cottage a lot this summer during the week. I know weekends are more precious so that\'s why I booked during the week instead. If any of you feel that I\'ve booked too much or would like some of the time that I booked, please let me know. I just booked what I did because I have my summers off but completely respect if you would like some of \"my time\". Thanks and summer is only a couple of months away... woohoo!!
~Maria~9:11pm~Apr 04, 2016~We did #6 - kindling. That\'s about all for this time of year - the lake is still frozen solid but oh so pretty. :)
~Dad~4:50pm~Feb 21, 2016~I did item 4 and 7 for 2016
~Maria~5:19pm~Jun 07, 2015~Just back from a phenomenal weekend at the cottage! We filled four of the gas jugs and loaded them into the boats and gas caddy. If you\'re a boat-user, please think about helping to fill the gas caddy as well. Happy summer!
~Maria~8:35pm~Apr 26, 2015~Hey all... there are some rotten wood floor boards on the outside upper deck beside the BBQ and over towards the back door to the \'cold room\'. Watch your steps!!
~Dad~2:44pm~Apr 06, 2015~I\'ve replaced the burner on the BBQ - it\'s good to go.
~Maria~3:04pm~Mar 22, 2015~BBQ is not working.. Dad has plans to replace it but someone to help transport / receive / assemble it at the cottage would be nice. Anyone?
~Maria~10:28pm~Nov 17, 2014~Outdoor water hose needs to be turned off (or the hose left on and the water pipe inside, turned off) so it doesn't freeze. Had a magical time this weekend with the boys, building a snowman (person?!) but forgot about the water. :)
~Dad~4:57pm~Aug 22, 2014~No need for anyone to do anything with the trees on the ground - I've hired a guy to come and chip them.
~Christian~1:13pm~Aug 19, 2014~Don't throw out the mouse traps!! All you need to do is press down on the lever over a garbage - no more mouse. If you are touching the mouse, you're doing it wrong.
~Maria~11:56pm~Aug 06, 2014~Some regular items to check on... the mice, for sure. And maybe bring a few traps with you, as we tend to throw out the entire traps along with the dead mice. Eewwwwww. 

Also, the BBQ tanks were all empty so please, if you take one off to replace it, either go into town and fill it up or leave a note here so the next person can do it.

Thanks for the new canoe paddles!! They're super-easy on the hands although didn't stop us from toppling over...

Oh yeah, and the upstairs bathroom door is cracked. Looks like someone slammed it really hard?! Totally broken, all the way from bottom to top and it doesn't close any more. 

If you're at the cottage and notice something like any of these things or if you break something, please try to take care of it or leave a note so we can all help to take care of the cottage and not leave these big or little things for Dad.

Besides all of that... enjoy!
~Maria~11:48pm~Aug 06, 2014~Cottage address:

23 Kamanik Circle
Val des Monts, QC
J8N 5E5
819-671-2331
~Dad~3:57am~Feb 08, 2014~I've cancelled the dial-up internet service at the cottage
~Maria~2:17pm~Aug 02, 2013~Sorry...I couldn't take the paddle boat out of the water on my own. Hope it survives the rain!!
~Jen~3:43pm~Jul 22, 2013~If you'd like to use the paddle boat, make sure you take it up out of the water before you leave so it doesn't fill with rain water. After the recent storm the thing was filled to the brim!
~Marlene~10:06am~Jun 03, 2013~Hi, I deleted my Aug. 9-11th booking and I think that's the last free weekend of the summer. It's now up for grabs :)
~Dad~11:15am~May 28, 2013~After using the Bayliner leave the main battery switch in the back of the boat in the "ALL" position so that the bilge pump has power.
~Dad~4:25pm~May 26, 2013~The dishwasher soap cover is now working again
~Marlene~8:03pm~May 20, 2013~One more thing... the black flies are awful this time of year so I suggest you bring some extra bug repellant and some benedryl / calamine lotion. I am itching all over and it's almost unbearable!!!
~Marlene~8:00pm~May 20, 2013~Hello cottagers! Just letting you know that the flap that holds the dishwasher soap does not open when the dishwasher is on. I suggest you don't close the flap when you're about to run it. That's what I did and it was fine. Have fun :)
~Dad~7:13pm~Sep 04, 2012~BBQ is now clean and ready to go
~Maria~10:57am~Aug 26, 2012~Hi everyone. I put oven cleaner on the 'items needed' list as its great for cleaning the BBQ. And the BBQ does need a good cleaning. So, if you've got some time and muscle, go for it. Spray away and leave overnight, then scrub the gunk off the grills the next day. Careful not to get spray anywhere other than on grills; it will stain! And take the note off this site if you do this, otherwise, I'll take care of it in September.
Thanks!
~Christian~4:24pm~Jul 23, 2011~Hi Everyone. I brought up a bunch of movies on the Xbox, including kids movies, as well as some old school Nintendo games. Remember, if the Xbox doesn't power on it's usually because the breaker on the AC adapter flipped. Just reset it to power the Xbox on.
~Maria~8:58am~Jul 22, 2011~Hey guys,
How about stacking all of the plastic chairs off the dock at night? The abyss of Lac Dam swallowed one of the big chairs while I was up there in July! It's easy... they can simply go on the grassy area near the gas caddy. Let's all have a safe and happy summer, folks.

~Mike~5:08pm~May 16, 2011~Molly maid now has 23 Kamanik Circle on his route- your time is up, dust bunnies. 
Whenever anyone sees me make a cottage booking during the week- once a month- just remember that it's a cleaning day, so I can rebook it if necessary.
The summer forecast says hot and dry.. oh happy day.
~Marlene and Eric~8:30pm~May 11, 2011~Hey all! Eric and I are open to having any of you join us in the weeks/weekends that we have booked for this summer... the more the merrier :)
~Dad~2:48pm~Apr 28, 2011~The septic system is OK again.
~Dad~10:33am~Feb 21, 2011~The septic system is frozen, so if you plan to go to the cottage you cannot use water.
~Christian~9:04pm~Jan 10, 2011~I moved the cottage directions to a separate page, linked to the main page.
~Dad~10:32am~Jan 04, 2011~I've posted directions on the To-Do List
~Jen~3:22pm~Dec 30, 2010~Would someone post the directions to the cottage here?
~Dad~3:30pm~Oct 24, 2010~There's dishwasher detergent on the pantry shelf in the workshop room.
~Marlene~6:11pm~Oct 17, 2010~Hello everyone! Maria, Justin, myself, Hannah and Dylan just spent the weekend at the cottage and had a fabulous time :) I just want to let you know about a few things. Whoever goes up next needs to bring dishwasher detergent because we're all out. One of the fireplace handles is broken (I believe the screw and bit for it is on the mantle). That's pretty much it. Enjoy your time there... especially during this beautiful fall season. The changing leaves are beautiful and Maria and I immensely enjoyed the full moon and starry evening when the kiddies were in bed! 
~Christian~2:44pm~Aug 15, 2010~Another great weekend at the cottage. Jacob stayed home with Oma and Opa this time so we could spend our wedding anniversary weekend in peace. Although it wasn't so peaceful - I found quite a large nest of bees underneath the front seats in the bayliner and got stung before I bolted out of there. Jenn was the hero that day as she suited up in heavy clothes and gloves to take out the bee nest, and she did! The mouse season has started early as we found evidence in the garbage under the sink where they made a real mess. Please be sure to remove the garbage out of the cottage before you leave, no matter how small an amount. I also found mouse evidence in the cutlery drawers and some other drawers. We had to wash everything in these drawers and clean them out. Please remember to set the traps before you leave the cottage. Also, I cleared a shelf in the workroom to use as a pantry shelf. Please use this shelf to store oversized pantry items so we don't have to hunt for these items elsewhere in the cottage.
~Mike~6:02pm~Aug 14, 2010~Too many cottage parties on the same weekend! Since "the house"(me) is busy on Labour Day weekend, the poker tourney is postponed until later in Sept. Details to follow.
~Mike~1:54pm~Aug 10, 2010~Tentatively, on Labour Day Weekend there's a poker tournament at the cottage! We're gonna gamble 'til the sun comes up. Whoever wants in just call me, and bring 25$!
~Marlene~3:00pm~Aug 09, 2010~Hey all, especially Jen and Christian. I forgot to put a note on the milk in the fridge but it's good until Aug. 22nd (it's 1%). Have fun :)
~Marlene~8:40pm~Jul 30, 2010~Hello fam! OK, just a few reminders of things I've been noticing while I've been at the cottage. Please remember to bring things that you normally wouldn't think to bring because we all use up this stuff when we're there (i.e. laundry soap, dish soap, dish detergent, toilet paper, paper towels, etc.). At least bring what you'll be using. Also, I've been watering the plants, out on the deck (every 2 days is good). And I think that's all folks :) Have fun :)
~Christian~1:00pm~Jul 18, 2010~Just leaving the cottage, great weather this weekend. Jacob went into the lake for the first time and loved it! I cleaned out the space under the stairs and left the mattresses out to air dry. I also attached the hose to the dehumidifier and placed the open end into the shower stall so it can run constantly. If you are up at the cottage and the dehumidifier is running, feel free to turn it off but please turn it on again before you leave(during the summer) as it can get very damp in the basement. Also, we took home a few pool cues to fix the tips and will bring them back next time we're up(August).
~Mike~1:40pm~Jul 13, 2010~All this cottaging but no one is harrassing the fish. I'll make up for all you pansies when I go up next. Mwahahahaa!
~Jen~2:51pm~Jun 28, 2010~I'd like to have the cottage July 16th-17th, but the bookings page won't let me because J&C have it booked 17th-18th. Is it OK (J&C) if I have for for the Friday night? We'd be out of there in the morning on Saturday.
~Jen~2:09pm~May 31, 2010~I bought after bite, a mosquito coil holder thing, and a BBQ basting brush and will bring them to the cottage June 11th (I removed these items listed on the "needs" list, but they will not be at the cottage until then).
~Marlenous~9:12pm~May 16, 2010~The mattress in the laundry room is clean and goes in the party room. (Dylan had an accident, but the mattress is now pristine!)
~Maria~10:45pm~May 04, 2010~Hey all, just wanted to say that I've booked some summer time at the cottage but I'm open to negotiations (and bribes!) and some open family time during those dates as well. Lemme know  :)

Happy summer!!!
~Karen & Mavis~7:40pm~Nov 30, 2009~If anyone finds Mavis' "bedtime bone" (her purple stuffed bone) in Grandma's bedroom can you please mail it to:

Mavis Friis
PO BOX 1317
Southampton, ON
N0H 2L0

It would be GREATLY appreciated!!!
~Dad~8:58am~Sep 16, 2009~I've just bought a new coffee maker and my old one is now at the cottage.
~Maria~12:27pm~Sep 07, 2009~Hey fellow cottagers (and coffee-drinkers)
The coffee maker at the cottage is broken!!!! Sorry! The spiral springy-thingy from the filter fell out and dropped into the kitchen sink drain before I could grab it. So, if anyone is heading up there and feels like buying a new coffee maker, just let me know and I'll reimburse you for it. 
Thanks :)
~Mike~8:39pm~Jul 19, 2009~Finally, finally, it's time to hit up some big fat bass action! Woohoo!
~Maria~10:50am~Jun 26, 2009~Yipeeeee!!!! Justin and Oscar and I are in for the 4th and 5th. :)
~Marlene~1:33pm~Jun 23, 2009~Hi everyone! Just to let you know, I've booked the cottage for me and the kids from July 2nd-5th. It's just me and the kids and Charlie so please feel free to come up and join us anytime :) We'd love the company! Hopefully we'll see you then...
~Maria~2:30pm~Apr 05, 2009~Here comes summer!!!
I've booked massive amounts of time at the cottage this summer but I am very flexible in having others join Justin and I or in changing the dates if any of you want alternate plans. Please let me know ASAP as I have friends beginning to book their holidays so they can come to the cottage with me. Muchos Gracias.  :)
~Maria~8:47pm~Apr 23, 2008~Hey fellow cottagers, 
I'm looking into booking holidays from work and would like to take Justin to the cottage, sometime in the week of July 5th-ish to July 12th-ish. We're completely open to other family visitors at this time. Just thought I'd put the request in as Dad has the cottage booked for the summer and it doesn't seem that you can 'double-book' on this system. 
Cheers!
~Jen~1:19pm~Jan 25, 2008~As I mentioned in an email, my friend thinks he lost his green jacket (with a Bonfire logo on the front) at the cottage. Apparently his mom would never let him forget that he lost it, so he seems pretty desperate...
~Maria~10:10am~Oct 20, 2007~Just tuning in now for the first time. Thanks for doing this Christian; it looks really great!
~Jen~5:58pm~Sep 24, 2007~Kasia lost her red scarf at the cottage. If you find it, could you let me know? Thanks!
~Mike~1:24pm~Aug 13, 2007~WooHoo! This is what's called a "tight ship". WTG Gurd. Now we just need a monster waterslide from the deck to the lake- I'll run it by some people (like Hannah, Dylan, Justin) to see if there's enough interest..
~Marlene~9:27pm~Aug 09, 2007~Well Christian, I must say I'm quite impressed but not surprised... you are a genius! This is a great site and I'm sure it will be used often. Way to go bro :)
~Dad~5:26pm~Aug 09, 2007~This is great, Christian!
~Christian~10:12am~Aug 09, 2007~I took the tube cover home to have restitched. I'll bring it back next time I'm up but if any of you want it before that you can come get it at our place.
~Christian~8:05pm~Aug 08, 2007~Welcome to the Friis Cottage online. Here you can book the cottage, post general comments, add grocery or other items to the required item list, and add to-do work items that need attention at the cottage. If you ever forget the password to the site just call or email me. And feel free to share your comments and suggestions on the site. Enjoy!
